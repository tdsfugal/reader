Build a JavaScript application that shows the latest news from the United Kingdom, using the newsapi.org service.

Running the app we should be able to see the latest UK news. The user should have the ability to filter by keywords (see everything endpoint api). Optionally, if the user clicks on a news item it will navigate to a page displaying the full news article selected.

This is a full stack challenge and we are expecting both a Frontend application and a Backend application that communicate with each other.

A Full Stack developer is someone with familiarity in each layer; you might be stronger on the frontend, or vice-versa. Feel free to focus more on what you know best, be creative and show us your skills!
